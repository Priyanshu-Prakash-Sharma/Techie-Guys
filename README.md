# Study Planner App

A simple JavaFX-based application designed to help students organize their study schedule efficiently. The app analyzes learning habits, syllabus progress, and exam dates to generate a dynamic study plan. It also adapts based on the user's performance in mock tests. The app fetches mock study plans from a service and displays them in an interactive graphical interface.

## Features

* Displays a list of study plans with subjects and time allocation.
* Simple, clean UI created using JavaFX.
* Fetches study plans data in JSON format and displays them.
* Ability to fetch and view study plans with dynamic interaction.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The core programming language used for the backend logic.
* **JavaFX:** A GUI framework used to build the graphical user interface.
* **JSON:** Used for managing and structuring study plans data.
* **Maven:** Build automation tool used to manage dependencies.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following installed on your local machine:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher:** You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
* **JavaFX SDK:** You can download it from [Gluon](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
* **IDE:** Any Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI-Personalized-Study-Planner.git](https://github.com/your-username/AI-Personalized-Study-Planner.git)
   ```

2. **Install JavaFX SDK:**
   * Download JavaFX from the link provided above.
   * Set up your IDE to include JavaFX in the project configuration. Follow your IDEâ€™s documentation for adding JavaFX libraries to your project.

3. **Set Up Project Dependencies:**
   If you're using Maven for dependency management, ensure the following is added to your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
           <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
           <version>17</version>  </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

4. **Compile and Run the Application:**
   After setting up the project, open it in your IDE and run the `StudyPlannerApp.java` file. The app should start and show a simple interface where you can fetch and display study plans.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with the following:

* **Button to fetch study plans:** Clicking the button will trigger the app to fetch mock study plans and display them in the console.
* **Study plan details:** The study plans are displayed with subjects and study time. *(How are they displayed?  In the console? A table in the UI?  Be specific.)*

## Future Improvements

* Integration with a real backend or database to fetch personalized study plans.
* User authentication to store study plans for different users.
* A more sophisticated AI algorithm to generate study plans based on performance.
* Improved UI with more features such as charts and progress tracking.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:** Uses headings and lists for better organization.
* **Markdown Formatting:** Uses Markdown syntax for improved readability on GitHub.
* **Specific Instructions:** Provides step-by-step instructions for setup and running the application.
* **Hyperlinks:** Includes links to download JDK and JavaFX.
* **Dependency Example:** Provides a clear example of the Maven dependency.
* **Placeholder for Display Details:**  Highlights the need to specify *how* study plans are displayed in the UI.  This is crucial information for someone trying to use the app.
* **Standard README Format:** Follows common conventions for GitHub READMEs.

**Crucially:**  The original text said the study plans are displayed in the console.  If they are displayed in the UI, you *must* correct that in the README.  The README must accurately reflect how the application works.  If the UI displays them, describe where in the UI they are displayed (e.g., in a table, a list, etc.).
